# Core Data Model

## What the Story Synthesizer Does

The story synthesizer skill helps you take context and synthesize it into **stories** that explain how a user engages with a solution or system(s) to create value. Stories are about **interaction**, but also about **structure**, **state**, and **rules**.

Your task is to **synthesize** source material into an **Interaction Tree** and **State Model** — meaningful exchanges between actors, plus the domain concepts and state that support them. Outputs: story map, domain model, acceptance criteria, specifications, walkthroughs.

**Hierarchy:** Epic → Story → Scenario → Step. Epics can nest (an epic whose parent is an epic is sometimes called a sub-epic). Epics group stories; the story is the backbone — the smallest unit that is both valuable and independently deliverable. Each story has Pre-Condition, Initiation, Response, and statement. Scenarios optionally group steps; steps are atomic interactions.

**State** runs alongside. Pre-Condition is what must be true before; Response implies resulting state. Domain concepts (the things that hold state and get operated on) are referenced via `**Concept**` in labels; each must exist in the State Model. Tree and State Model evolve together — no drift.

All concepts are defined below. See the output folder: `output/interaction-tree-output.md` and `output/state-model-output.md` for format and presentation.

## Interaction Model

An interaction is a single meaningful exchange between two actors that results in either a retrieval of state or a change of state.

### Interaction

- **Name** — name of the interaction. **Ground in domain:** Every epic, story, scenario, and step must be grounded in domain language — either in the name or in the statement — using `**Concept**` (double stars, capitalization). Domain concepts must appear in `**Concept**` format so the domain conditions are described.
- **Statement** — one-sentence initiation and response; include state concepts where appropriate.

**Name and statement (all nodes):** Use active verb language. Short name first, longer statement in brackets. Format: `Node: Short Name (Longer statement.)` — e.g. `Step 1: Browse Country for Payment (When **User** browses countries; Then **System** displays...)`. Name is always verb-noun or subject-qualifier; statement is always the longer sentence. **Epic statement:** Describe the scope of the epic (broad flows), not a single interaction. **Story/Step statement:** One initiation and response.
- **Impacts** — zero or more (see Impact below)
- **Constraints** — zero or more. Qualitative instructions on how this interaction is shaped. A constraint may be a sentence, a reference to a collection of files, or (most commonly) a reference to a markdown file. Constraints are inherited from high to low (parent → child).
- **Pre-Condition** — label only. What must be true before. State qualifies through the label. Use `**Concept**` to reference domain concepts; each must exist in the State Model.
- **Initiation** — Initiating-Actor, Behavior (label), Initiating-State. Initiating-State is any state that qualifies the interaction (e.g. selecting an option of a certain type). Labels reference domain concepts; examples live on the interaction.
- **Response** — Responding-Actor, Behavior (label), Resulting-State. Resulting-State is the state that results from the interaction. Labels reference domain concepts; examples live on the interaction.
- **Examples** — collection of tables at the interaction level. One per concept referenced in labels. Pre-Condition, Initiation, and Response reference these through their labels; examples live on the interaction.
- **Failure-Modes** — up to three; how the exchange can fail (rule/state based only)
- **Children** — child interactions of this interaction.

#### Interaction Tree Rules
**Node Hierarchy**
- Epic - Can nest to have epic children or story children. An epic whose parent is an epic is sometimes called a sub-epic. Names are typically simple verb-noun.  
- Story - Smallest unit of testable value that is independently delivered. Names are typically simple verb-noun.  
- Scenario - Groups steps; optional container for a story. Names describe the primary conditions tested in the scenario.  
- Step - Atomic interaction within a scenario. Steps are interactions: often in the form of **Initiation** (When) and **Response** (Then). 

Epic → children (Epics, Stories)  
Story → Scenarios OR Steps
Scenario → Steps  
Step --> lowest interaction for now

**Commonly Generated Fields Vary By Node Type:** 
Any node level can use any field. Exceptions are always possible. The table below lists what we commonly generate for each node.

| Node | Commonly generated | Case By Case Generated |
|------|--------------------|------------------------|
| Epic | Initiating-Actor, Responding-Actor, Name (Verb Noun), Impact, Constraints | Pre-Condition, Initiating-State, Resulting-State, Examples, Failure-Modes|
| Story | Initiation , Response ; Name (Verb Noun), Examples, Pre-Condition (eg BDD backgroun, Given, And); Failure-Modes, Constraints |
| Scenario | Initiation, Response, Pre-Condition (eg BDD Given, And); Examples |
| Step | Initiation, Response,(When, And, Then, And); Examples; Constraints (when step-specific) |

**Nodes inherit attributes from their parents.** 
Child nodes inherit state, examples, pre-conditions, actors, domain concepts, and constraints. You can show inherited attributes explicitly in square brackets (e.g. `Initiating-Actor: [User]`, `Examples: [Logged In User, Active Session]`) so readers see which values came from the parent. When you use brackets, update them if the parent changes. **Inheritance applies either way** — even when you don't show brackets, the inherited values still apply to the child. See Hierarchy Inheritance for conventions.

**Inheritance that we often want to call out explicitly through the [inherited thing] notation**
- **Epic from Epic:** Domain concepts. Lower-level epics (sub-epics) often use the inherited domain concepts from their parent epic.
- **Story from Epic:** Initiating-Actor, Responding-Actor, Pre-Condition, Examples based on Pre-Condition, domain concepts.
- **Scenario from Story:** Almost nothing needs to be explicitly stated.
- **Step from Story:** Initiating-Actor and Responding-Actor are often used, eg [User] and [System] from the story or higher. Exception: when a step is system-initiated (e.g. "When **System** receives payment type selection"), that step may override Initiating-Actor.

**Domain grounding:** Every epic, story, scenario, and step must be grounded in domain language. This primarily comes from the interactions (e.g., initiation and response) if they have been defined, but if they have not been defined, then it would come from the  the name or  the statement. When When initiation and response have been defined, the name is based on those, but sometimes we don't define these for a node, and just define the name at first. In either case, all of the above need to be grounded using `**Concept**` (double stars on both sides, capitalization). Avoid generic terms; use `**Country**`, `**PaymentType**`, etc., not "country" or "payment type". Concepts must come from the state model here. Concept identified as part of exploring the interaction tree should be added to the state model and vice versa. When we add things to the state model, we should explore which interactions require those and update accordingly.

Concepts are placed at the level of the interaction hierarchy where they apply to all descendants. Every `**Concept**` must exist in the State Model — no drift.

### State

State qualifies an interaction through its **label** — a description of the condition. The interaction's **Examples** (tables) live on the interaction; example and label reference the domain concepts that correspond to those tables.

### Pre-Condition
 What must be true before the interaction. Label only (may use Given/And BDD format). Examples live on the interaction.

### Initiation 

Who starts the interaction and what they do.

- **Initiating-Actor** — who starts the interaction
- **Behavior** — the label. Describes the action. Use When/And for steps, Given/When/Then for BDD, or verb-noun as appropriate.
- **Initiating-State** — state that qualifies the interaction (e.g. selecting an option of a certain type). Labels reference domain concepts; examples live on the interaction.

### Response (Then)

Who responds and what they do.

- **Responding-Actor** — who responds (typically system, subsystem, or component)
- **Behavior** — the label. Describes the response. Use Given/When/Then for BDD, or verb-noun as appropriate.
- **Resulting-State** — the state that results from the interaction. Labels reference domain concepts; examples live on the interaction.

### Impact

Applies to Epic, Story. An interaction may have an impact; a known result can provide evidence for another impact (tie a hypothesis to a result).

- **Type** — user | economic | feasibility
- **Status** — hypothesis (we don't know yet) | result (measured outcome for an existing system)
- **Description**
- **Evidence-Ref** — optional; links to another impact that is a result

### Constraints

Any node at any level can have one or more **constraints** — qualitative instructions on how this interaction is shaped. A constraint may be:
- A sentence (inline text)
- A reference to a collection of files that describe the constraint
- Most commonly: a reference to a markdown file

Constraints are inherited from high to low (parent → child). Typically appear at epic or story level; may appear at step level when step-specific.

## State Model

The State Model holds **modules** (groupings of tightly related concepts) and **domain concepts** — the things that have state and can be operated on. Concepts are referenced in interactions via `**Concept**` in Pre-Condition, Initiation, Response, and Failure-Modes. Every `**Concept**` must exist in the State Model; concepts must be placed at the right level in the hierarchy. No drift between tree and model. Use source entity data, not aggregated/calculated values.

### Module

Grouping of tightly related concepts.

- **name** — module name
- **concepts** — list of tightly related StateConcepts

<!-- section: story_synthesizer.core.state_concept -->
### State Concept

A domain concept that holds state and can be operated on. Referenced in interactions via `**Concept**` in labels. Examples live on the interaction.

- **Name**
- **Module** — optional; grouping of tightly related concepts
- **Base-Concept** — optional
- **Properties** — with optional collaborating concepts and invariants
- **Operations** — with optional collaborating concepts and invariants  ; It should be easy to reverse engineer the interactions in the interaction diagram to at least some level of operations on the state model.

## Hierarchy Inheritance

Attributes from a parent node are inherited by child nodes. **Brackets indicate inherited values.** Use `[value]` or `[inherited]` so readers see what applies at each level; if the parent changes, update bracketed values in children.

**Inherited attributes:** Examples, actors. Place concepts at the lowest level where they apply to all descendants. Concepts are indicated by `**Concept**` in labels — no separate list.

**Convention:** `Initiating-Actor: [User]`, `Responding-Actor: [System]` — brackets mean "from parent." Unbracketed values are defined on this node. Use Title Case for field names; hyphens for compound terms (e.g. Pre-Condition); no dot notation.

**Guidelines for inherited values:**
- **Statement by level:** Epic statement describes the *scope* of the epic — the broad flows it encompasses — not a single interaction. Use `**Concept**` to ground in domain. Good: (**User** initiates **PaymentType** flows that vary by **Country**; **System** validates and executes per **Country**.) Bad: (**User** selects **Country** and **PaymentType**; **System** validates.) — that describes one story, not an epic. Story statement: one initiation and response. Step statement: When/Then for that step.
- **Pre-Condition:** Never use `Pre-Condition: [inherited]` alone. Always include the label (bracketed) so readers see what applies.
- **Initiating-Actor / Responding-Actor:** Use `[User]` or `[System]` at every initiation/response so the actor is visible without looking up. Use Title Case; no dot notation (e.g. `Initiating-Actor`, not `initiation.actor`).
- **Examples:** Live on the interaction. Use `[inherited]` when tables come from parent; list the qualitative names (e.g. `[Logged In User, Active User Session, User Payment Type Access]`). Include step-specific or story-specific examples unbracketed.
- **Example table names:** When you have data, you need a label. Name by state or condition — "Selected Country", "Selected PaymentType", "Approved Payment" — not generic labels like "Payment" or "Country". For mapping tables use descriptive names (e.g. "Payment Type Field Types"). When data varies by type, include the type (e.g. "PaymentDetails (wire)"). When multiple tables for the same concept appear in one step, add a qualifier in parentheses (e.g. "Selected PaymentType (selected, not available for country)"). When inherited, list those names: `examples: [Logged In User, Active User Session, User Payment Type Access]`.
- **Example scenario column:** Use a scenario column to map example rows to outcomes. Use kebab-case consistently (e.g. success, invalid-payment-details, payment-type-not-available).
- **Example block format:** Use `===` between tables. No blank lines between tables. Tables require a header separator row (`|---|---|`). Pattern: `Name:\n| col1 | col2 |\n|---|---|\n| data | data |\n===\nNext name:\n| table |`.

**Rule:** Put shared concepts at the epic level; only add story-specific concepts at the story level. Epic holds initiation state for rules that apply to all children (e.g. user access to payment types by country). Epics (including epic children of epics) group; they do not add initiation/response state. Stories inherit Pre-Condition, Initiating-Actor, and Responding-Actor from Epic.

**Placement rule:** Only put something at a level if it applies to every descendant. If a failure mode, concept, or rule applies only to specific scenarios or stories, place it on those nodes — not at the Epic.

## Complete Example

A typical reference hierarchy for making a country-specific payment (initiate, make transaction, fulfill). **Concepts** are referenced via `**Concept**` in labels. **Examples** live on the interaction. Pre-Condition, Initiation, and Response qualify through their labels. Epic holds rules that apply to all children (e.g. user access to payment types by country). Epics group; they do not add initiation/response state. Stories inherit from Epic. One story is taken to full detail with scenario and steps. (Other epics and stories not yet filled out.)

**Hierarchy levels:** Epic → Story → Scenario → Step (epics can nest; an epic child of an epic is sometimes called a sub-epic)

**Name and statement:** Active verb language, short name first, statement in brackets (see Interaction).

### Hierarchy

#### Epic: Make **Country**-specific **PaymentType** (**User** initiates **PaymentType** flows that vary by **Country**; **System** validates and executes per **Country**.)
- Initiating-Actor: User
- Responding-Actor: System
- Pre-Condition: Given **User** is logged in; And **User** has an active **Session**; And **User** has access to **PaymentType** in **Country** (see **UserPaymentAccess**)
- Examples:
  Logged In User:

  |------------|-----------|-------------|
  | success    | Jane Doe  | Payer       |
  | payment-type-not-available | Jane Doe  | Payer       |
  ===
  Active User Session:
  | scenario   | user_name | session_id | expires_at |
  |------------|-----------|------------|------------|

  | ach          | amount, currency, beneficiary_id, routing_number, account_number |

  #### Story: **User** Initiates **Country**-Specific **PaymentType** (**User** determines **Country** and **PaymentType**; **System** validates and confirms.)
  - Pre-Condition: [Given **User** is logged in; And **User** has an active **Session**; And **User** has access to **PaymentType** in **Country** (see **UserPaymentAccess**)]
