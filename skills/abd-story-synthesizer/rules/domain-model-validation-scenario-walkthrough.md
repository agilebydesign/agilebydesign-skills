## Scenario / Message Walkthrough

Make sure the model can actually behave. A model that looks elegant but fails in message flow is not good OOAD.

**Run walkthroughs for:**
- Happy path
- Error path
- Edge case
- Exception path
- Stateful repetition
- Alternate variation mode
- Recovery, retry, or cancellation where relevant

**Validate at two levels:**

**Scenario flow:** What happens in the domain?

**Message flow:** Which object sends what message to whom? Does the receiver know enough to act? Is the sender delegating a decision or making it centrally?

**This step exposes:** missing objects, misplaced behavior, centralization, fake relationships, state with no owner.

**DO NOT** truncate. Full Model Assessment requires multiple scenario walkthroughs with message flow (happy path, error path, edge case, stateful repetition, alternate variation, recovery where relevant). Persist the full assessment in run-N-ooad.md. A one-line note is insufficient.
