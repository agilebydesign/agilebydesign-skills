## Verb-noun format

Use verb-noun format for epic/story/step names and steps. Actor documented separately. Use active voice, base verb forms, and business language for all interaction text. Use behavioral language — describe what happens, not how it's implemented. Use domain concepts in steps (Given/When/Then) — not UI labels. Applies to all nodes (epic, story, step, scenario), including steps in or out of scenarios. (Merges active_business_and_behavioral_language, use_verb_noun_format_for_story_elements, behavioral_ac_at_story_level, and scenario_language_matches_domain.)

**DO** use Actor → verb noun [qualifiers]. Actor is documented separately, NOT in the name.
- Names: "Places Order" (actor: Customer); "Validates Payment" (actor: System); "Process Order Payment".
- **Step format** — strategy may specify When/Then (strict) or vanilla (verb-noun). Show both:
  - **When/Then:** `When **User** browses countries; Then **System** displays list of **Country** options`.
  - **Vanilla:** `User submits form`, `System validates payment`, `Select item from list`.
- Use base verb forms (infinitive/imperative): "Select Tokens", "Group Minions", "Process Payment".
- Use behavioral terms: "When user enters name; Then system saves character information" (not "system writes to JSON").
- Use domain concepts in steps: "User selects **Country**", "User enters **PaymentDetails**" (not "User clicks dropdown", "User fills form field").

**DO NOT** include actor in name, use noun-only, gerunds, or third-person singular.
**DO NOT** use technical implementation terms (config, json, api, sql, class, method). Use behavioral language instead.
- Wrong: "Customer Places Order" (actor in name). Right: "Places Order" (actor: Customer).
- Wrong: "Order submission", "Payment processing", "Form validation" (noun-only). Right: "Submit order", "Process payment", "Validate form".
- Wrong: "Submitting order", "Selects item", "Displays confirmation" (gerund/third-person). Right: "Submit order", "Select item", "Display confirmation".
- Wrong: "Then system saves to JSON file", "Then system parses XML", "Then system executes SQL query" (technical). Right: "Then system saves configuration data", "Then system processes data", "Then system retrieves data".
- Wrong: "User clicks dropdown", "User fills form field", "User submits button" (UI). Right: "User selects **Country**", "User enters **PaymentDetails**", "User submits payment".
